The Sun is extra bright today!
its a solar eclipse! you shouldnt look at it!
I forgot sunglasses...
NO NO even if you forgot sunglasses you shouldn't look!

anyone got a telescope spare? I want to check out Saturn
You'll have a better chance at mars or the moon
It might be a good time of the year to see Venus though.
telescopes are crazy expensive...
on a good night - or without light pollution - you could try looking at orions belt

Still crazy that the sun orbits our world.
Actually the earth orbits the sun!

Did anyone know that our moon is called Luna?
I did! the sun is also called Sol!
