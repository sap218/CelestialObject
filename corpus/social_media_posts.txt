The Sun is extra bright today!
its a solar eclipse! you shouldnt look at it!
I forgot sunglasses...
NO NO even if you forgot sunglasses you shouldn't look at the sun directly!

anyone got a telescope spare? I want to check out Saturn
You'll have a better chance at mars or the moon
It might be a good time of the year to see Venus though.
is it venus or mars that is known as the red planet?
telescopes are crazy expensive...
on a good night - or without light pollution - you could try looking at orions belt

Still crazy that the sun orbits our world.
Actually the earth orbits the sun!
Thank you for the information :-)

so who agrees that PLUTO is a planet?
its a dwarf planet #StillAPlanetToMe

Is the ISS fast? How about comets?

Did anyone know that our moon is called Luna?
I did! the sun is also called Sol!
does Earth have a name?

Did you know the Mars Rover sings Happy Birthday to celebrate the landing anniversary? #RoverFacts

Is the sun yelling or are those flares crazy today? #joke
Saturn has more rings than i do

anyone else believe in aliens? :o 
Well I did just watch the movie, Mars attack

stars are pretty tonight!

what time of the year can I see the Big Dipper?
If you're in the UK then you can see it all year, but I guess it depends where you are because of light pollution.
It looks like a pan to me
Samee!
